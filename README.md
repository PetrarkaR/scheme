I have seen this in a geohot video, later that day I swapped to a new laptop with fedora on it and now im developing it from there, I dont know how long it will take me to finish the book, gonna try to do it by the 21st of april. gonna log my journey.

Firstly a good idea would be to automate testing.
'Test.sh' is the file for that.
On the 18th of april at 11:15 PM we have successfuly cleared the parsing part of the book for the most part, now we go onto Evaluating. What does that mean? 
To evaluate a statement means, if someone gives you 5+5 , you output 10.
Onto the next chapter
