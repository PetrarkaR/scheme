I have seen this in a geohot video, later that day I swapped to a new laptop with fedora on it and now im developing it from there, I dont know how long it will take me to finish the book, gonna try to do it by the 21st of april. gonna log my journey.

Firstly a good idea would be to automate testing.
'Test.sh' is the file for that.
